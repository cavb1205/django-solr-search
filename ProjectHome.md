## Introduction ##
Django Solr search is a Django pluggable for rapidly integrating Solr search into a Django Application. It was originally written for [The Washington Times](http://www.washingtontimes.com/). Readers where complaining that they were never able to find relevant content and they weren't given the tools to narrow down their search. With some of our past experiences with Solr it seemed like the obvious choice for this type of enterprise search concept.

## What Django Solr gives you ##

Enterprise ready search that is easy to integrate, but also provides hooks for customization.
